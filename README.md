# 🔐 Caesar Cipher – Cyber Security Internship Task at Prodigy Infotech

## 📌 Task Objective :-

The goal of this task was to:
- Create a Python script capable of **encrypting and decrypting** user-input text.
- Accept a **custom message** and a **shift value** from the user.
- Apply the Caesar Cipher algorithm to shift letters accordingly and return the output.
- Build understanding of **data confidentiality** through basic encryption techniques.


## 🧠 What Caesar Cipher :-

The **Caesar Cipher** is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. It is one of the earliest and simplest methods of encryption, historically used by Julius Caesar to protect military messages.


## 💡 Key Features of the Project :-

- The program allows **interactive input** for the message and shift value.
- It supports both **encryption and decryption**, depending on user choice.
- It handles **uppercase and lowercase letters**, maintaining their original case.
- **Non-alphabetic characters** such as punctuation or numbers are preserved without changes.
- The shift logic uses **modular arithmetic** to wrap around the alphabet.


## 🖥️ How the Program Works :-

1. The user is prompted to choose between encryption ('e') or decryption ('d').
2. The user inputs the message to be encrypted or decrypted.
3. The user enters an integer shift value.
4. Based on the choice, the shift is either added or subtracted from each character.
5. The final result is printed to the console.


## 📂 File Included :-

- `caesar_cipher.py`: This script contains the complete logic and functionality for Caesar Cipher encryption/decryption.
  

## 🚀 How to Run the Program

```bash
python caesar_cipher.py
